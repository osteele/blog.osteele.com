[PackageMapper](http://packagemapper.com/) shows you a map of your FedEx, UPS, USPS package routes. Enter a carrier and a tracking number to see your package’s progress plotted on the map. Sign in to enter a list of packages and see their current locations on a table or map.

This is an itch I’ve wanted to scratch for about a year now: being able to see where all my packages are on a map. On Thanksgiving morning I discovered [SimpleTracking.com](http://www.simpletracking.com/), which gives you an RSS feed for a UPS or USPS package. Over Thanksgiving weekend I added FedEx and mashed it up with Google Maps, and this is the result.

I can’t guarantee that this will stay up if it starts to get much traffic, but in the meantime I’m finding it useful myself, so, enjoy.
