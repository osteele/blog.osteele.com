Check out [myLaszlo.com](http://www.mylaszlo.com).  As well as showing off some examples, this is a way of getting free hosting for Laszlo applications written using the Laszlo Presentation Server's [Developer Edition](http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/) -- which is also free.

Some applications that people have already posted:

* A [Tree View](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000054.html) control, in less than 70 lines of [code](http://mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/viewer/viewer.jsp?file=/max/treecontrol/treecontrol.lzx).  The Laszlo User's Group has written some notes about it [here](http://www.laszlouser.org/page.cfm?doc=Aug%205%202003&wikiid;=1944).

* The [Pot Store](http://mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/pablo/store/store.lzx).  Sarah Allen has [written](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000053.html) about the development of this application.  Try clicking on a pot -- there's an interesting use of layouts here.

* An online version of Sam LLoyd's [Fifteen Puzzle](http://mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/bazan/14-15Problem_improved/14-15Problem_improved.lzx).

* My [Laszlo Blogging Widget](/2003/08/laszlo_blogging_widget.html).

and almost a dozen more.
