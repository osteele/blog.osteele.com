I just finished moving some heavy furniture around within my apartment.  This was harder than it sounds, because I'm not allowed to put a heavy load through my spine.  I had to come up with ways of lifting and moving furniture that transmitted the forces across different parts of my body instead.  I ended up sliding around on my back on a towel on the floor, and pushing the furniture above me, so that I could use my arm and chest strength instead of my back.

If you'd asked me beforehand, back surgery and the following limitations would have sounded like a terrible burden to live with.  Actually, it's been a lot of fun to evaluate my body for the first time as a complex system, and try to hack it --- to figure out what it can do.  I realize this is part of being a jock, which I missed out on in adolescence.  I had never realized that the things I'm good at --- understanding complex systems, building things with them, and looking for loopholes --- were good for what I thought of as the opposite of an analytical activity as well.

Marvin tells a story of a friend of his who had a stroke.  For more than a year, he couldn't walk.  But a year after that, he walked into Marvin's office.  Marvin asked him how he did it.  "One day I was just thinking of a piece of music", he said, "and I noticed that my toe twitched.  I tried to think of the same music again, and it twitched again.  So I tried thinking of different things, to see what would make different parts move.  It took me about a year."  "That sounds excruciating," Marvin told him.  "On the contrary.  It was the most fun I've ever had."
