The first third-party Laszlo application is available on the web!  The Behr ColorSmart color selector is available at [http://www.behr.com](http://www.behr.com) (as well as kiosks in Home Depots around the country, where it's been available for several months now).  It's unreal seeing this finally go live after seeing it from the inside last year and after all the work to build the initial version of the product while this was in development ---  at times I felt like we were running ahead of the train, trying to lay new track before it reached the end.
