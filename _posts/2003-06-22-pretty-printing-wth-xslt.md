I recently wrote a pretty-printer for [LZX](http://www.laszlosystems.com), in [XSLT](http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/).  [Here](http://www.laszlosystems.com/lps-v1/viewer/viewer.jsp?file=/sample-apps/weather/weather.lzx) is the source code to the [Laszlo Weather application](http://laszlosystems.com/lps-v1/sample-apps/weather/weather.lzx); click on "View Source" on the [Laszlo Demos](http://www.laszlosystems.com/demos/) page for other examples.
