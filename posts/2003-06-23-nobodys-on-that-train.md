I used to be an unrepetant nineteenth century grammarian.  I never used a preposition to end a sentence; I took care <strike>to never</strike> never to split an infinitive; I knew "who" from "whom"; and I never, ever, used "they" for "he or she".

I swore off the first three affectations when I realized that not only did was I trying to communicate with one hand tied behind my back, but that the first two restrictions [weren't even native to English](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive) in the first place (and the third --- "whom" --- didn't have any more place than "thou" or "yclept").  But "they" for "he or she" always galled me.  It was the mark of a careless speaker, in a league with "between he and I".

I made the first step towards changing my mind at [Apple Cambridge](http://osteele.com/museum/apple_dylan.html) in 1994, when we were writing the [Dylan Interim Reference Manual](http://core.federated.com/~jim/dirm/interim-contents.html) (DIRM).  Jeremy Jones insisted that the DIRM should use gender-neutral language.  This wasn't difficult for the bulk of the manual, which described the Dylan programming language.  But it caused some difficulties in the forward and preface.

[I didn't write the DIRM forward or preface, but we all kibitzed about it.]

The fact that it was hard to fix this forced me to confront a new question: which was more important, publishing the most natural-sounding reference manual, or doing our bit against gender bias in language?

(To believe in this distinction, you have to be something of a [linguistic determinist](http://venus.va.com.au/suggestion/sapir.html).  Doug Hoftstadter, in his brilliant and amusing essay "[A Person Paper on Purity in Language](http://www.bloomington.in.us/~abangert/person.html)", makes perhaps the best case that linguistic determinism is real.)

I decided at the time that nothing I was working on was important enough to be worth continuing sexist traditions --- even if being sexist could further its goals, in this case by allowing for sentences that matched the ears of twentieth-century listeners.  If I could have saved lives or fought world hunger by writing sexist language, I would have had a conflict.  But documenting a programming language?  No contest.

Ten years later I decided to admit third person singular "they" into my lexicon.  I predict that within a hundred years it will be mainstream anyway (just as "so" can now modify participles, and "fun" is now an adjective --- both changes within my lifetime).  And it fixes sentences that just can't be said with "he or she".

### Postscript

Marvin Minsky later told me that he faced the same decision in writing [The Society of Mind](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0671657135/oliversteele-20/ref=nosim).  He said that since he was trying to write about minds, not people, each sentence he rewrote to remove gender ended up more clearly about minds as well.
