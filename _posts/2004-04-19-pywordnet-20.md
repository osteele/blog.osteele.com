After a spate of requests and a contribution from Wei-Hao Lin, I've finally gotten around to releasing an update of [PyWordNet](http://pywordnet.sourceforge.net/) that works with the [WordNet 2.0](http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/) database files.  (WordNet 2.0 adds lexical links for derivational morphology and topical classification.  This broke the PyWordNet 1.4 dictionary file parser.)

This release also adds a module, contributed by Des Berry, for reading the concordance data; and an implementation of Lexname by Klaus Reis.  I don't know how these work, so ask for help on the PyWordNet [discussion group](https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=86245), or from the authors.

PyWordNet is an OO and command-line interface to the WordNet lexical database.  PyWordNet lets you manipulate words and senses thus:

        >>> N['dog']
        dog(n.)

        >>> N['dog'].getSenses()
        ('dog' in {noun: dog, domestic dog, Canis familiaris},
         'dog' in {noun: frump, dog}, 'dog' in {noun: dog},
         'dog' in {noun: cad, bounder, blackguard, dog, hound, heel},
         'dog' in {noun: pawl, detent, click, dog},
         'dog' in {noun: andiron, firedog, dog, dogiron})

        >>> dog.pointerTargets(MEMBER_MERONYM)
        [{noun: Canis, genus Canis}, {noun: pack}]

With the included wntools module, you can also compute meets and joins on words, and use the dictionary for quick-and-dirty stemming:

        >>> meet(N['dog'][^0], N['cat'][^0])
        {noun: carnivore}
        >>> meet(N['dog'][^0], N['person'][^0])
        {noun: organism, being}
        >>> meet(N['thought'][^0], N['belief'][^0])
        {noun: content, cognitive content, mental object}

        >>> morphy('dogs')
        'dog'
        >>> morphy('churches')
        'church'
        >>> morphy('aardwolves')
        'aardwolf'
        >>> morphy('abaci')
        'abacus'

As before, PyWordNet is available from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywordnet/).
