The code samples from my [talk at the Ajax Experience conference](/2008/09/practical-functional-javascript) are now available [here](http://osteele.com/talks/ajaxian-2008/samples).

Each example runs itself when you load its page, at least in Safari and Firefox.   This is something I first did for my talk at [LL2](http://ll2.ai.mit.edu/).  It's the only way I've ever been able to keep sample code actually working[^1].

The full slide deck (including these code samples, but without the comments and the ability to run the code) is [here](http://www.slideshare.net/osteele/oliver-steele-functional-javascript-presentation).

These are from the final draft of the talk, but they're really the first draft of this material.  The audience was great, and I learned a lot about how to explain this from their questions during the presentation.  I'm planning to reorganize and expand this the next time I get a free weekend to work on it.

[^1]: A funny story about that:  John Resig asked me after the talk whether I'd looked at [Learn JavaScript](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/).  The truth is, I'd wanted to get by without any fancy slideware or sample scaffolding at all, but I needed a way to get formatted code into Keynote.  I started out using a technique that [Scott MacVicar](http://www.macvicar.net/blog/2008/06/source-code-hig.html) came up with, and eventually added section breaks, and then "Previous" and "Next" buttons, until I'd eventually feature-creeped my way up to something pretty similar to John's tool. Oh well.
