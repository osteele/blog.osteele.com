I first met the folks at Laszlo Systems in December of 2000, when I was the CTO of AlphaMask.  A decade earlier Laszlo's founder David Temkin, my business parter Mike Reed, and I had all worked at Apple on technologies associated with the Newton.  Mike and I were in San Francisco, and David invited us by to see Laszlo.

At the time, I had been thinking of getting someone from the MIT Media Lab to design a user interface that took advantage of AlphaMask's animation and scaling capabilities to go beyond the desktop metaphor.  When I saw what Laszlo was doing, I stopped considering this.  "If I ever want to do anything interesting with 2D interfaces", I thought, "I should do it at Laszlo".

David was interested in licensing our graphics engine, but Laszlo didn't have any money.  A year later, in October 2001, Mike and I sold AlphaMask to OpenWave.  And in November, Laszlo received its seed funding.  David called us to ask whether our graphics engine was still available for licensing.  It wasn't, but I was.  I signed a six month contract.

I agreed to work for Laszlo because I thought the technology was amazing, and because I was looking for something to do while I decided what I wanted to do longer term ---- probably start a company in the Boston area.  During my first six months a couple of things happened.  One was that I realized this was a real company, with a business plan and business people as good as the engineers.  Another was that I really enjoyed working with everyone.  So six months later, instead of leaving Laszlo to start my own company, I suggested they hire me and start a Boston office, and a year later, here I am.
