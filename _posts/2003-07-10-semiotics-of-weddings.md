A wedding is a coercion operator from a state, to an event that marks the beginning of the state.  (The English word "marriage" denotes either.)  The advantage of an event over a state, is that it can be used as a reference for other events, symbolizing happiness, community, fertility, ,etc., by placing these other events at the same time and location.  This is analogous to time binding in linguistics.
