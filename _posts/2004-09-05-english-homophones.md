(For Miles.)

| Possessives  | Places | Contractions | Verbs |
| :-           | :-     | :-           | :-    |
| our          | .      | .            | are   |
| .            | here   | .            | hear  |
| .            | where  | we're        | were  |
| their        | there  | they're      | .     |
| its          | .      | it's         | .     |
| your         | .      | you're       | .     |
| his, her, my | .      | .            | .     |

Read _across_ the rows to see words that are easily confused with each other.  Read _down_ the columns to see the patterns.

Things to note:

* _All_ of the contractions have apostrophes '.

* _Nothing_ in this table that isn't a contraction has an apostrophe.  "Its roof is red" doesn't have an apostrophe even though "its" is a possessive.  This makes "its" _different_ from noun possessives ("The house's roof is red"), but the _same as_ "his", "her", and "their" ("Her hair is red").

* The place words all have "here" in them: "_here_", "t_here_", and "w_here_".

* Nothing that _isn't_ a place name has "here" in it: "Their hands are wet", "They're leaving".

If you notice you're using a word in this table, think about which _kind_ of word it is (Possessive, Place, Contraction, or Verb), or which column it fits into.  If you're using "its", would "his" also work?  Or would you use a verb such as "we're" --- in which case you should be using "it's" instead.

Once again, I'm sorry about English spelling --- I would have done it differently.  It's not my fault.
