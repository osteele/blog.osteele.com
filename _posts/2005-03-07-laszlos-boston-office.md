Laszlo's main office is in a [spiffy office building](http://www.laszlosystems.com/company/contact/) in San Mateo.

But Boston Product Development (basically, the [OpenLaszlo](http://openlaszlo.org) development team) works out of a [cafe](http://www.espressoroyale.com/).

This puts us in [good company](http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66276,00.html).  (And we get better coffee, too.)

Henry posted [some photos](http://niftykeen.blogspot.com/2005_03_01_niftykeen_archive.html) he took last week.  Here's one; click on the image for more.
