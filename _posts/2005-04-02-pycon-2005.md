The slides from my [PyCon 2005](http://www.python.org/pycon/2005/) talk about [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) and the [OpenLaszlo](http://openlaszlo.org) compiler are [online](http://osteele.com/talks/Laszlo%20PyCon%202005.pdf) (PDF).  I've corrected some dates and minor typos:  3K+1.5K does _not_ equal 6K, as I realized once I was standing at a podium with a large slide that displayed my math skills behind me, and a large number of technically sophisticated smart people in front of me.

Some illustrations from the talk:

## [KRANK](/2004/03/optimizing-for-broadband) dataflow

Dataflow for implementation of the [KRANK feature](/2004/03/optimizing-for-broadband) for startup time optimization:

## Script compiler dataflow

Dataflow for the OpenLaszlo ECMAScript compiler:

(The [PDF](http://osteele.com/talks/Laszlo%20PyCon%202005.pdf) shows what the data looks like at some of these stages.)

## [Serverless deployment](http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000009.html)

Deployment diagrams with (top), and without (bottom), the OpenLaszlo server.  Deploying with the server requires a J2EE servlet container (Tomcat, JBOSS, Weblogic, Websphere, etc.).  Serverless deployment works with Apache and consumer-price ISPs (such as [the one](http://dreamhost.com) that hosts [this website](http://osteele.com)).

(Caveat: the server also handles caching, GIF transcoding, RPC, and the persistent connection, as [this animation](http://www.laszlosystems.com/products/platformoverview/lps_flow.php) illustrates.  The diagram above just shows the initial download.)
