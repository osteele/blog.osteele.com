The slides from my [PyCon 2005](http://www.python.org/pycon/2005/) talk about
[Jython](http://www.jython.org/) and the [OpenLaszlo](http://openlaszlo.org)
compiler are [online](https://osteele.com/talks/Laszlo%20PyCon%202005.pdf)
(PDF).  I've corrected some dates and minor typos:  3K+1.5K does _not_ equal 6K,
as I realized once I was standing at a podium with a large slide that displayed
my math skills behind me, and a large number of technically sophisticated smart
people in front of me.

Some illustrations from the talk:

## [KRANK](/2004/03/optimizing-for-broadband) dataflow

Dataflow for implementation of the [KRANK
feature](/2004/03/optimizing-for-broadband) for startup time optimization:

## Script compiler dataflow

Dataflow for the OpenLaszlo ECMAScript compiler:

(The [PDF](https://osteele.com/talks/Laszlo%20PyCon%202005.pdf) shows what the
data looks like at some of these stages.)

## [Serverless deployment](http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000009.html)

Deployment diagrams with (top), and without (bottom), the OpenLaszlo server.
Deploying with the server requires a J2EE servlet container (Tomcat, JBOSS,
Weblogic, Websphere, etc.).  Serverless deployment works with Apache and
consumer-price ISPs (such as [the one](http://dreamhost.com) that hosts [this
website](https://osteele.com)).

(Caveat: the server also handles caching, GIF transcoding, RPC, and the
persistent connection, as [this
animation](http://www.laszlosystems.com/products/platformoverview/lps_flow.php)
illustrates.  The diagram above just shows the initial download.)
