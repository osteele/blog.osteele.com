We have a No TV in our living room.

Sometimes I think it's our most valuable possession.

Our No TV gives the whole family somewhere between one and six extra hours every day.  It's hard to add hours to a day, but the No TV does it.

Miles uses the time for making stop-motion movies and Flash animations.  Charlotte uses it to read, and write, and compose pieces on the piano.  I use it for writing (code), and writing (English), and to teach myself algebra and geometry and management theory and finance.  Margaret uses it for her many projects too.  We wouldn't have time for any of this, if it weren't for our No TV.

The No TV comes with other benefits as well.  It creates a few square feet of floor space.  And it pays out a few hundred dollars a year.

In fact, we like our No TV so much, we've put one in each of the bedrooms too.
