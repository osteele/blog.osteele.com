> Do you have an old teletype with a 5-bit serial interface sitting around that you've been itching to hook up to the Internet?  If so, this article at LinuxDevices.com is just what you've been looking for. -- [anonymous on Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/08/21/0129209.shtml?tid=106&tid;=126&tid;=137&tid;=185)

Henry Minsky has [written](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2384631403.html) in LinuxDevices about his Internet Teletype.  This is a vintage teletype he purchased on eBay, that is connected through a Mini-ITX and a web server to an email account.  The email account is in turn connected to his Yahoo calendar.

The upshot of this is that Henry has a Model 28 Teletype sitting in the middle of his living room (right, with [Kiki's Delivery Service](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JM2O) on floor), which chatters out reminders  for company meetings and other events.

> While this project required few of the many capabilities of the Mini-ITX system, the other projects on my list are all great candidates for using this board; high quality video and audio, as well as low power consumption, low noise, and most importantly low price will make this my platform of choice for future midnight engineering projects.
