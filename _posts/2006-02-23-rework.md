[reAnimator](/tools/reanimator) got me interested in writing something that would let you *use* regular expressions.  That something is [reWork](/tools/rework).  This web page has a couple of fields where you can type in a regular expression and a string to match it against, and see the results update as you type.  It also displays the code to perform the match in some of the languages (JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby) that I use with regular expressions.

reWork limited to the features of the JavaScript regex engine.  In particular, it's missing dotall (`/.../s`), because JavaScript is.  I actually figured out a hack to implement dotall anyway, but this will have to wait for another day.

<strike>I suspect that it still has bugs involving scanning and splitting on regular expressions that match the empty string, and browsers that aren't Safari and Firefox 1.5, but I'm publishing this now in the hope that it will be useful anyway.</strike>
