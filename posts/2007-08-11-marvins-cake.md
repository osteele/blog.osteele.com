Marvin's birthday cake:

based on [Marvin's book](http://www.amazon.com/Emotion-Machine-Commonsense-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/0743276639):

and created by [these folks](http://www.partyfavorsbrookline.com/).

I think they did an amazing job.

I suggested the "zero to infinity" since it's what you get if you turn "80" sideways.  I had in mind a "zero" over the "lazy" eight, [tex]0 \atop \infty[/tex], but I think it's more readable as it was translated through two phone calls into the image above.
