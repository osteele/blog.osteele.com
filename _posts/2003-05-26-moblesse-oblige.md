Or, easements for WiFi.

I can use a wireless access point for one of two purposes.  I can place it inside my (home or corporate) intranet and make it secure.  Or I can place it outside my intranet, and broadcast its presence to [WAR drivers](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless/WarDriving/?il=1).  But I can't do both.

[Actually, I can't do the first, because [WEP isn't secure](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~astubble/wep/).  But [WPA will fix this problem](http://www.google.com/search?q=wpa+wep), and it won't fix the other one.]

Wireless access points should come with a setting that permits public access through them to the internet, but only secure access to the intranet they're serving.
