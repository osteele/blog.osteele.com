I've turned this into a web page [here](/words/fortunately).

I prototyped it with a screen scraper for Google, but I didn't want to deploy a screen scraper.

Fortunately, Google has a Search API.

Unfortunately, Google's API uses SOAP.

Fortunately, Ruby has a SOAP library.

Unfortunately, the Ruby SOAP library doesn't work on Dreamhost.

Fortunately, the Yahoo Web Search API uses REST.

Unfortunately, Yahoo's summaries don't include enough right-hand context, so it's harder to extract decent sentences from them.

Maybe I'll go back to screen-scraping after all.

**Update:** Jim tells me he got the idea from Jorg Brown at Google.
